Synthesis of Ultra Wide Band Waveforms
--------------------------------------

Once the propagation channel has been evaluated. This is done in the
``pylayers.antprop.channel`` module. The received signal is evaluated in
applying a convolution product of each ray tranfer function with a
specific IR-UWB waveform. The necessary modules are

-  ``pylayers.signal.bsignal``.
-  ``pylayers.signal.waveform``
-  ``pylayers.signal.channel``

The module ``pylayers.simul.simulem`` is for definition of
electromagnetic simulation.

Generation of an Impulse of normalized energy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One possible manner to define an energy normalized short UWB impulse is
as follows using ``bsignal.EnImpulse`` function.

The default waveform is a gaussian windowing of a sine wave of frequency
:math:`f_c`. The normalization term depends on the exponential scaling
factor :math:`\tau`.

:math:`p(t)= \frac{\sqrt{2\sqrt{2}}}{\tau\sqrt{\pi}} \cos(2\pi f_c t) e^{-(\frac{t}{\tau})^2}`

:math:`\tau = \frac{2}{B\pi}\sqrt{\frac{\gamma_{dB}\ln{10}}{20}}`

where :math:`B` is the desired bandwidth defined at :math:`\gamma_{dB}`
below the spectrum maximum and :math:`f_c` is the central frequency of
the pulse.

.. code:: python

    fc     = 4 
    band   = 2
    thresh = 10
    fe     = 100 
    ip     = EnImpulse([],fc,band,thresh,fe)

Above the waveform is a generic UWB waveform. The interested user can
add easyly any other mathematical expression of UWB waveform for
investigation on pulse waveform modulation for example. The waveform can
also comes from measurement. For now there are two version of this
waveform which has been used during the M1 measurement campaign. One is
not compensated ``W1compensate`` for an extra short delay which can
introduse a bias when interpretating the observed delay in terms of
distance. The non compensated version is ``W1offset`` from the time
origin about 0.7 ns.

The waveform class should grow for incorporating more waveforms,
especially waveforms compliants with the current IEEE 802.15.4a and IEEE
802.15.6 standards.

.. code:: python

    wavmeasured = Waveform(typ='W1compensate')
    wavmeasured.show()

    wavmeasured.show()


.. image:: Signal_files/Signal_20_0.png


Here the time domain waveform is measured and the anticausal part of the
signal is artificially set to 0.

To handle properly the time domain wavefom in PyLayers, it is required
to center the signal in the middle of the array. The waveform has
embedded in the object its frequency domain and time domain
representation.

-  ``st`` member stands for signal in time domain
-  ``sf`` member stands for signal in frequency domain

.. code:: python

    print type(S.wav.sf)
    print type(S.wav.st)

Construction of the propagation channel
---------------------------------------

The following representation shows the spatial spreading of the
propagation channel. On the left are scattered the intensity of rays wrt
to angles of departure (in azimut and elevation). On the right is the
intensity of rays wrt to angles of arrival. It misses the application
between the 2 planes as well as the delay dimension of the propagation
channel.

    ctx = S.L.pt2cy(tx)
    crx = S.L.pt2cy(rx)
The sequence of command below :

-  initialize a signature between cycle ctx and cycle crx
-  evaluates the signature with a given cutoff value
-  calculates a set of 2D rays from signature and tx/rx coordinates
-  calculates a set of 3D ray from 2D rays and layout and ceil height
   (default H=3m)
-  calculates local basis and various geometric information out of the
   3D ray and Layout
-  fill and reorganize the interactions object with proper material
   chararcteristics

Evaluate the propagation channel :math:`\tilde{\mathbf{C}}`. Here the
meaning of tilde is that the complex value of the channel do not include
the phase term due to delay along the ray.

.. code:: python

    C = r3d.eval(fGHz) 
Construction of the transmission channel
----------------------------------------

The transmission channel is obtained from the combination of the
propagation channel :math:`\tilde{\mathbf{C}}` and the vector antenna
pattern at both side of the radio link. This operation is implemented in
the ``prop2tran`` method of the ``Ctilde`` class.

.. code:: python

    sc = C.prop2tran()
The transmission channel is obtained by applying a vector radiation
pattern using an antenna file.

In the presented case, it comes from a real antenna which has been used
during the **FP7 project WHERE1** measurement campaign M1.

.. code:: python

    sc

    dist :8.01560977094 29.8514551319
    Friis factor -j c/(4 pi f) has been applied



The antenna radiation pattern is stored in a very compact way thanks to
Vector Spherical Harmonics decomposition. The following gives
information about the content of the antenna object.

modulus and phase of the ray transfer function.

If a realistic antenna is applied it gives

.. code:: python

    sca = C.prop2tran(S.tx.A,S.rx.A)
Calculate UWB Channel Impulse Response
--------------------------------------

Once the transmission channel has been evaluated on can convolved the
waveform with the channel impulse response to get the received waveform.

    r.y

Hermitian symetry enforcment
----------------------------

If the number of point for the transmission channel and the waveform
were the same the mathematical operation is an Hadamrd-Shur product
between :math:`\mathbf{Y}` and :math:`\mathbf{W}`.

:math:`\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{S} \odot \mathbf{W}`

In practice this is what is done after a resampling of the time base
with a reinterpolated time step.

The process which consists in going from time domain to frequency domain
is delegated to a specialized class ``pylayers.signal.bsignal.Bsignal``
which maintains the proper binding between signal samples and their
indexation either in time or in frequency domain.

.. code:: python

    wgam = S.wav.sfg
    Y    = sc.apply(wgam)
    tau  = Y.taud
    dod = Y.dod
    doa = Y.doa
The transmission channel has a member data which is the time delay of
each path in nano seconds. Notice that by default those delay are not
sorted.
